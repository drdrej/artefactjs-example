  "readme": "# npm-registry\n\nTo keep myself sane while working with The npm Registry I decided to write my\nown library to deal with all the incomplete, inconsistent and horrible data\nstructures that are available in The npm Registry. NoSQL is nice and all, but\nthat doesn't mean you should leave your data unmaintained. This library is never\nmeant as a full replacement of the `npm-registry-client` which the `npm` bin\nfile is using. Unless those API's and methods are so poorly implemented or\ndesigned that I get a mental breakdown, then yes, this will become a full and\nusable replacement of the above said module.\n\nThis module is written with high availability in mind. The main reason behind\nthis is that npm Inc. has added a lot of moving parts on top of the registry\nwhich frequently breaks. In order to combat this I've implemented automatic\ndowngrading to multiple registries. If all other supplied registries fail to\nwork an automatic exponential randomized back off algorithm kicks in place and\nretries the query once more. This functionality is all provided by the awesome\n[mana] package which provides core functionality for writing sane api-clients.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save npm-registry\n```\n\nAnd that is all you need to type in your terminal in order to prevent becoming\nterminal. The `--save` tells `npm` to automatically add the package and latest\nversion to your `package.json`.\n\n### Packages\n\nThe `.packages` endpoints allows you to retrieve detailed information about npm\npackages. The following methods are implemented:\n\n- `npm.packages.get`: Basic module information.\n- `npm.packages.depended`: List modules that depend on the given module.\n- `npm.packages.starred`: List users who starred the module.\n- `npm.packages.keyword`: List packages who use this keyword.\n- `npm.packages.releases`: All releases for a module.\n- `npm.packages.release`: The latest release.\n- `npm.packages.details`: Highly detailed information about the package.\n\n### Users\n\nThe `.users` endpoint allows you to retrieve detailed information about a given\nnpm account. The following methods are implemented:\n\n\n- `npm.users.list`: All packages released by the user.\n- `npm.users.starred`: Packages that the user has starred.\n- `npm.users.get`: Get the profile information.\n\n## Normalization\n\nAs the internal data structure is do damn awkward in npm we need to normalize the\ndata structures before we can even try to use it. While this normalization is\npart automatically done for you internally there might be use cases where you\nwant to manually normalize a given dataset.\n\nThe normalize module can be required directly using:\n\n```js\nvar normalize = require('npmjs/normalize');\n```\n\nThe `normalize` variable now contains two different functions, `users` and\n`packages`. As you might have guessed, these functions normalize different data\nstructures. The function accepts a simple single argument which is the data\nobject that you receive from the npm registry endpoints.\n\n```js\ndata = normalize.packages(data);\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n[mana]: http://github.com/3rd-Eden/mana\n",
